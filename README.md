Assignment 1: Finding the Correlation

Goal: Extract data points from an online graph, calculate Pearson's correlation coefficient, and provide a visualization.

1. Data Collection Process

    The data was collected from the following address: max.ge/aiml_midterm/93254_html.

Coordinates were extracted by hovering over the blue data points on the provided interactive graph.

    The following 9 points were recorded (swapped according to the specific axes requested):

        X (Vertical Axis): [0.60, 2.250, 4.90, 7.10, 9.40, -1.40, -3.70, -5.90, -8.20]

        Y (Horizontal Axis): [0.90, 2.240, 4.20, 6.10, 8.50, -1.10, -2.80, -4.90, -7.50]

2. Calculation & Methodology

    The calculation was performed using Python's scipy.stats library.

Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (r): 0.99880.

The result indicates a near-perfect positive linear relationship between the variables.

3. Visualization

Figure 1: Scatter plot showing the strong positive correlation between the extracted coordinates.
